#ioPlus
###A Monkey module that does some basic file input&output. It also adds support to the native Windows Phone 7 keyboard (Not perfect though). And it has a two, or one button notification dialog.

More info about ioPlus in the [community thread](http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=2679).

More info about Monkey in the [official website](http://www.monkey-x.com).

Note: This project is no longer maintained as Monkey has added official file input/output and without that, this project has very few extra things to offer and having it as a part of a module is not that useful. So take whatever you need from it and use it as a part of your own library if you wish.
